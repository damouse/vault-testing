# Vault Testing

Run with `docker-compose up`.

This might be a useful [link](https://www.melvinvivas.com/secrets-management-using-docker-hashicorp-vault/) for setting up the container with config and intended caps.

See also [here](https://medium.com/@pcarion/a-consul-a-vault-and-a-docker-walk-into-a-bar-d5a5bf897a87) for getting configuration into the container, though it might be easier to just map in an external file. I just don't know how to do that yet.
